# meet-my-team-generator

## Desription
Using node and javascript I have created a application that takes in a users responses and renders the information into a team profile. Purpose: You can quickly and easily create a team profile by using a command-line application to generate one. This allows the project managers to quickly showcase their teams skills.

 You are prompted to enter the team managerâ€™s name, employee ID, email address, and office number. When you decide to finish building your team then I exit the application, and the HTML is generated.
